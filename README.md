# FEND-FSND_Movie_Trailer_Website

## Project Overview
The FEND-FSND Movie Trailer Website project is a part of the Udacity Front End and Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegrees. The goal of this project is to create a dynamic website that displays a list of movies and their trailers. This website is built using Python to generate HTML for the website, styled with CSS.

The project is structured as follows:
- `entertainment_center.py`: Main Python script that you will run to generate the website. It creates a list of movie instances and calls the method to generate the HTML file.
- `media.py`: Contains the class Movie that stores details of a movie.
- `fresh_tomatoes.py`: Contains the open_movies_page function that takes in a list of movies and generates an HTML file including this data, facilitating the website's layout and design.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
